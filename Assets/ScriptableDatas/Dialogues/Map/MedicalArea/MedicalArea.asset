  - "The research and medical district, home of the brightest brains in our beautiful
    city, that\u2019s what\u2019s in the brochure anyway...\r\n"
  - "The true side of this district is one of competition above anything else, the
    hospitals and labs fighting tooth and nail to get more funding than their neighbors.
    Sometimes they go to far, and even the cult can\u2019t stop their antics from
    making news headlines."
  - "As far as clues go, I\u2019ve heard of a specific lab that was visited by Keanu
    a few days ago, and a hospital where cult members are often seen, practicing charity,
    so they say.\r"
  - "Now, where should I begin here\u2026 Most of the buildings here are tightly locked,
    and I\u2019m not really tough enough to face off with the security guards they
    have. I may have another way of proceeding though, I have an old press pass that
    might get me in one of the labs, not sure if it still works though.\r\n"
  - "There\u2019s also one of my old college friends who works as a secretary in one
    of the hospitals, maybe she could let me in\u2026\r\n\r\nWhat to do what to do
    ?\r"
