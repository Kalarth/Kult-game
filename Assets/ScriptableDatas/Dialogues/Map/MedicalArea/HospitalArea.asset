  sentenceList:
  - My friend let me in the hospital without problem, and I even had time to ask her
    a few questions about the supposedly charitable cultists that came and went there.
  - "Apparently they offered religious service for the sick as well as food and drinks
    for the patients and their family\u2026 That and they also left suspiciously with
    red cases."
  - My friend managed to tip me off when they were leaving and I followed them as
    silently as I could, they were carrying red containment cases with yellow stickers
    my friend late identified as symbols marking containers of human organs for transplants
    and sensitive robotic parts such as spines and cyberbrains.
  - They must have heard me at some point because they started running away and took
    off in a van. I did manage to snap a picture off at the last moment though.
  - "So, there I had it, the cult was stealing organs from hospitals, for what end,
    I had no idea, for now.\r"
