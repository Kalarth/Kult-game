  - "I did my best to appear inconspicuous as I walked in the offices of the town
    hall, the trick is if you look enough like you have a good reason to be there,
    people will never question why you\u2019re actually where you are."
  - "Eventually I managed to make my way to the deputy mayor\u2019s office, besieged
    by journalists that had stayed to ask for an explanation for the cancelling of
    the press conference. "
  - "After a short while I noticed a few security guards escorting him out through
    a back door, following them I saw them get into a car and drive away straight
    towards the church.\r\n"
  - Looks like our dead deputy mayor may have some closer ties to the church than
    I thought...
