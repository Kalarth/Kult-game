  - "Slums, what more is there to say ? Cheap megaplexes crowd the horizon like a
    forest, but living there ? That\u2019s if you\u2019re lucky. "
  - "Every time I come here I see at least one person with The Look. An air of total
    hopelessness, as if they\u2019re just waiting for it all to end\u2026This city
    is like a beast, it eats people up, take everything they have, and those that
    survive the process end up here.\r"
  - Walking in the streets I come across the remains of an anti cult protest, it seems
    to have been led by teachers, out of all people. But as I walk towards it a short,
    very skinny woman asks for help nearby.
