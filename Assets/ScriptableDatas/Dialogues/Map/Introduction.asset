  - 'Another rainy friday night in this hell hole of a city, I watch the drops hit
    my window, reflecting the blue neon lights coming from The Church, pale points
    of blue radiating from the center of town, never to fade away. Another rainy friday

  - "The cult of the Eternal One, our glorious overlords in their grand and gaudy
    church, they practically own the entire city, hell they funded most of it if my
    research on the matter is accuracte, not that you\u2019d know about it, the cult
    members like to keep their identities unknown and their business private.\r"
  - "This ends tonight, I\u2019ve seen how these people dispose of others as they
    please, they decide who\u2019s in power, what laws are drafted, voted for and
    how they are applied, how they stop the police from investigating key members,
    and you\u2019re sure not going to hear about any of that from the trids, the media
    is in their pocket too."
  - "It\u2019s high time someone did something to expose them as the crooks they really
    are, for someone to tell the people what they deserve to know, and I have the
    perfect opportunity tonight."
  - ' I have an old camera with no matrix controlled chips inside, a hacker ready
    to slice into the major news mainframes when the time is right, and a window to
    get into the church and surprise the cult leader, Keanu when they do their ritual
    of ascention. '
  - "All I need now is concrete evidence, in order to sway the people, something that
    they won\u2019t be able to ignore or dismiss as circumstancial. \r\n"
  - "I\u2019ve been tipped off that the cult is doing shady stuff around the city
    tonight, in preparation for their mysterious ritual, but I don\u2019t know where
    exactly. I better get going and start looking around town now, there\u2019s only
    so much time before the ritual is supposed to start\u2026"
  - "I better be going now, clock is ticking, wish me good luck, and I\u2019ll be
    back with the truth.\r\nDelilah Conway, signing out.\r"
