  - 'I followed the official to his meeting, apparently fancy restaurants are where
    these things happen, talk about seeing your tax money at work right ? '
  - In any case I managed to get seated not far from them, ordered the cheapest thing
    on the menu which was still way too expensive, and tried my best to listen to
    what they were talking about.
  - "I didn\u2019t get much out of it, sentences were buried under legal jargon I
    didn\u2019t quite understand, but I did hear things about tax returns, and I\u2019m
    pretty sure I saw money discretely changing hands.\r"
