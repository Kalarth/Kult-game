  - 'I followed the woman and her incoherent rambling through a side alley, something
    about someone having fainted. I could sense something was wrong about a second
    before he started running like hell as several men came out from the corner of
    the alley. '
  - " Not waiting to find out anything more about them I turned and bolted away, another
    man was set up behind me to block my exit but I managed to shove him away, don\u2019t
    ask how I barely remember the details with the adrenaline and all."
  - " I eventually managed to outrun them after a tense couple of minutes but got
    lost in the labyrinth of alleys and narrow streets. Must have taken me an hour
    to get out to my car, I\u2019m never visiting this neighborhood again if I can
    help it.\r\n"
