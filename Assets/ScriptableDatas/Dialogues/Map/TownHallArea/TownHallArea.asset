  - "The town hall\u2026 home of the politicians we all know and love\u2026 Nah I
    won\u2019t even try to say that with a straight face, this place is a hive of
    corruption and sleaze, you know it, I know it, everyone knows it. "
  - "Sometimes I wonder if they even try to be discrete with it anymore.  \r\nI know
    there is a meeting going on with a member of the cult and an official somewhere
    in the building, but I\u2019m not necessarily sure there will be any juicy details.
    \r\n"
  - "There\u2019s something else interesting going on, the deputy mayor has cancelled
    a press conference at the last minute, with no reason given. This may not be anything
    substancial, but seeing something is happening with the cult tonight\u2026 this
    couldn\u2019t be a coincidence, right ?\r"
